The people who lived in the village nearby sensed that something was off and they knew it wasn't just the weather. That was when they started to hear strange noises coming from the old, abandoned house on the hill. Whispers, creaks, and groans seemed to emanate from within its walls at night. The wind howling through the broken windows sounded eerily like a mournful cry. People dared not enter, as if some malignant spirit guarded the entrance. They called it the cursed house, and its history was as dark as the shadows that clung to it. Rumors said it had once been a place of unspeakable evil, a site where a cult practiced dark magic, summoning entities from beyond the veil. The village had prospered after their banishment, 300 years ago, but the house remained, a testament to the horrors that had unfolded beneath its roof. Now, with the strange happenings, it seemed something stirred once again. The villagers avoided the hill, hoping whatever evil was awakening would pass them by. However, not everyone shared their fear. Elara, a young and ambitious journalist, had heard the stories but saw them as mere folklore. She was determined to uncover the truth behind the abandoned house and the recent disturbances. Equipped with her notebook, pen, and a flashlight, Elara approached the house as the sun dipped below the horizon. The villagers watched in silence, their faces lit only by the flickering lights of their homes, as she climbed the hill. The house loomed before her, its silhouette menacing against the deep blue sky. Elara pushed open the creaking front door and stepped inside.
